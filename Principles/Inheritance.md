Prototype Chaining and Object.prototype
JavaScriptâ€™s built-in approach for inheritance is called prototype chaining, or prototypal inheritance.

	propertyIsEnumerable() => Determines whether an own property is enumerable
	isPrototypeOf() => Determines whether the object is the prototype of another
	valueOf() => Returns the value representation of the object
	toString() => Returns a string representation of the object

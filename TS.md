# TypeScript OOP

## Static keyword
Classes contain properties, methods and attributes. Properties belong to a class or and instance of a class. 

When we use the static keyword on properties we define on a class, they belong to the class itself.

An attribute or a method is a class member because they can ONLY be accessed through the class itself; therefore, they're members of the class.

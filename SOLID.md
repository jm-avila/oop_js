# SOLID OOP

SOLID are five principles of Object-Oriented class design.

Introduced by Uncle Bob, Robert J. Martin, in his paper [Design Principles and Design Patterns](https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/2032/1/design_principles.pdf)

The SOLID acronym stand for:
- Single Responsibility
- Open-Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

## Single Responsibility

A class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

## Open-Closed

Classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality.

## Liskov Substitution

Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

## Interface Segregation

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need.

## Dependency Inversion

Classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
